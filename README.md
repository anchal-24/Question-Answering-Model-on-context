# Project Title

Question-Answering-Model-on-context

## Getting Started

1)These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites and Installing

2)Create a new envrionment and Install All The required dependencies ( install flask_ngrok if you want to host it)
It's better to have a good GPU for traning and Good RAM for testing


### Training
3)Run all the cells of all layers

4)Then if you want to train the model

  i) if you want to continue the tranining then run the cp cell to copy the model to current session
  
  ii) If you don't want to continue then skip this cell and continue on the next cell 
  
  (It will take 3-4 hours to run one epoch)


## Running the tests

5) For running testing A flask website will be created and with the help of ngrok you will be able to test it online (This is little flawed right now)
6) Otherwise, you can direcly test it by creating a new model and loading your trained model and then passing the query and context to it.
